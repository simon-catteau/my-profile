		<h1>Hello, I'm Simon ðŸ˜‰</h1>
		<img src="images/myphoto.jpg" class="img-circle" width="100px" alt="Simon CATTEAU">
		<p>I am a master student at the IESEG School of Management and I am part of the school's social and environmental entrepreneurship association called Enactus </p>
		<a href="https://enactus.fr/" class="btn-green">My association</a>

		<h2>Enactus</h2>
		<p>
		I have been a member of this association for 2 years now. The objective of the association is still the same: 
		to promote social and environmental entrepreneurship, but I have carried out several different tasks since I became a member. 
		Indeed, I have been a member of the sponsorship pole, then responsible for this pole, then I was treasurer and now I am responsible for the communication pole.   
		</p>

		<h2>Sports</h2>
		<p>
		Among the elements that could define me, Sport is an important part of my life. Currently I don't practice anymore because of wrist injuries but normally I'm interested in learning a new discipline. 
		Here are some sports I have played and am looking forward to playing again: tennis, football, snowboarding, volleyball and karate.    
		</p>

	<div class="card-white">
		<h2>Travel</h2>
		<p>
		The final element that defines me is travel. This element defines me more by a goal than by past actions. 
		Indeed, travelling and discovering many countries is one of my biggest goals at the moment. 
		Soon I will travel to Italy, and my dream is to go to Japan and do a roadtrip in the nature.
